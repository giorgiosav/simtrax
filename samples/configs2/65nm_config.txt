This file tries to explain some of the things about the
65nm________.config files.

The file name indicates the frequency and the number of threads
assumed to be in each TM (32, 48, 64).

There is 1 FPADD per 8 threads and 1 FPMUL per 8 threads.

There is 1 FPINV per TM.

There is 1 INTMUL per 16 threads.

The L1 cache size is indicated by the second to last number (in
kBytes) and the number of banks is the final number.

The size of the L1 cache is computed using the following data.

dcache:
16x4 = 285100
16x8 = 438800
32x4 = 415000
32x8 = 574900
64x8 = 834800

icache:
1 per 16 threads
16 bank = 146300

localstore (one per thread):
512B = 19470
